## Features

In making one of the world's most popular and trusted cryptocurrency wallets, we know a thing or two about serving high quality data to thousands of users at once. This fiat API service has been built from scratch to meet our goals.

* Extremely high performance and reliability, written from the ground up using the super-fast LMDB database.
* Infinite scalability across multiple server regions.
* Distributed and redundant, with support for unlimited price collection and end user quote delivery servers.
* Optional load balancing on the same server network with a custom LMDB load balancer.
* Low cost, with fast, low-resource lookups and delivery.
* Privacy-respecting with no user logging.
* Fetch spot and historical pricing data (30+ days old) for thousands of fiat and cryptocurrency pairings.
