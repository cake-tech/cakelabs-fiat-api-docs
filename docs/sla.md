## SLA

We care about running our service with high uptime, so we offer the following SLA:

## For prepaid shared plans

You can purchase a SLA for a 100% credit premium (min $50 / month). If selected, we will apply credits by taking your then-current level of credit spend for the month and applying the following additional credits:

| Monthly uptime percentage | Service credit percentage |
| --- | --- |
| 99.95 to 99% | 10% |
| 99 to 98% | 20% |
| 98 to 90% | 50% |
| 90 to 50% | 100% |
| 50 to 0% | 200% |

## For premium dedicated plans

Your SLA is included at no extra charge! The service credit is a percentage of your bill for your then-current level of spend for a month.

| Monthly uptime percentage | Service credit percentage |
| --- | --- |
| 99.95 to 99% | 10% |
| 99 to 98% | 20% |
| 98 to 90% | 50% |
| 90 to 50% | 100% |
| 50 to 0% | 200% |

## Credit request

To receive a service credit, you must submit a claim by contacting Cake Labs by email. To be eligible, the credit request must be received by us by the end of the second billing cycle after which the incident occurred and must include:

i. the words “Cake API Credit Request” in the subject line;

ii. the dates and times for each unavailability incident that you are claiming; and

iii. your request logs that document the errors and corroborate your claimed outage (any confidential or sensitive information in these logs should be removed or replaced with asterisks).

If the monthly uptime percentage of such request is confirmed by us and is less than the service commitment, then we will issue the service credit to you within one billing cycle following the month in which the request occurred. Your failure to provide the request and other information as required above will disqualify you from receiving a service credit.

## Exceptions

The SLA does not apply if the following situations occur:

* Downtime occurs following a partner's request, for example to upgrade infrastructure to meet their specifications.
* Downtime occurs as a result of a targeted attack against the relevant infrastructure by a nation state or terrorist organization.
* The downtime applies to an onion (Tor) and/or i2p API endpoint, not a clearnet endpoint. Unless specifically specified in an SLA, onion and i2p access is not guaranteed.
* Downtime results from any actions or inactions of the partner.
* A partner exceeds usage limits.
* One or more of our service providers experiences a global network outage or bankruptcy.
