## Privacy

Privacy is extremely important to us.

Here are some major differences between our API privacy policy and our competitors':

### We don't track your users

We only collect information about the number of used calls or used bandwidth for your account, that's it. We don't collect your user's IP address, and we don't sell their data.

### We offer onion (Tor) endpoints for all plans

No special plan necessary! All API planholders get access to our high-performance onion (Tor) endpoint in additon to the clearnet endpoint. Give your users peace of mind knowing that we can't collect information from them, even if we wanted to!

### Privacy is our DNA

[Cake Labs](https://cakelabs.com) has been building privacy software for longer than most people have known about Bitcoin. Cake Labs launched Cake Wallet, the first iOS Monero Wallet, in January 2018, and released Monero.com in 2022.

We run high-performance cryptocurrency nodes for our users with the same strong privacy policies, and we design our products to be privacy-respecting from the start.
