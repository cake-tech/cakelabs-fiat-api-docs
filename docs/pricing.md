## Pricing

There are two ways to pay for the API:

* **Prepaid shared**: Pay for a certain number of API credits, and we keep track of usage. Get your first 100,000 credits for just $10.
* **Premium dedicated**: Pay a base cost for infrastructure and get billed monthly for bandwidth use, with unrestricted API use.

### Options/upgrades/configurations

* **Custom domain**: Place our service behind your domain for a white-label experience.
* **100% SLA guarantee**: Included on high-volume plans, or pay a monthly SLA cost with prepaid shared.
* **Public access code**: We support publicly-shared API access codes for an extra cost. Perfect for reproducible builds.
* **Proxy connections**: If you think you can be more efficient than us, we allow you to deliver our data directly to your users from your own servers for an extra cost.
* **Additional regions**: We include several global server locations by default, but we can add additional locations with load balancing as desired.

### Included in all plans

* **Pay with crypto or fiat**: We accept BTC, XMR, USDC, USDT, and bank payments.
* **No user logs**: [Privacy](/docs/privacy) is important to us, so the only thing that's tracked is your account's current API credit or total used bandwidth.
* **Highly optimized API**: Save you and your users bandwidth.
* **Tor support**: Make an onion (Tor) endpoint available to your users for maximum privacy. One Tor call costs two credits.
* **Commercial use**: Use it for personal or commercial use for no additional charge.
* **Massive or unlimited rate limits**: Make up to 20 connections per second, per IP address (not per key). Larger limits are available.
* **Basic DDoS attack prevention**: One less thing to worry about.
* **Unlimited products and users**: Use the API for whatever you want (except reselling) and for however many users you want.

## Prepaid shared

*We have a promotional price where your first 100,000 credits are only $10! No add-ons allowed with this offer.*

| Queries | Cost | $/Query |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 100,000 | 50 USD | $0.0005 |
| 500,000 | 100 USD | $0.0002 |
| 5,000,000 | 500 USD | $0.0001 |
| 50,000,000 | 2500 USD | $0.00005 |
| 500,000,000 | 5000 USD | $0.00001 |

You can save a HUGE amount of money with prepaid shared, since credits roll over into future months!

## Premium dedicated

You can optionally customize your own dedicated plan. The hardware isn't shared with anyone else. This premium plan is best for extremely intense applications or highly-custom configurations. You can also negotiate different Terms of Use to meet your needs.

Premium: (Regions) * ((Nodes + 1) * 70)

| Regions | Delivery nodes per region (plus included balancer) | Monthly Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2 | 210 USD |
| 2 | 2 | 420 USD |
| 2 | 3 | 560 USD |
| 3 | 2 | 630 USD |

### Additional required costs

* Capture node: 20 USD / month / node (minimum 2)
* Bandwidth cost: 10 USD / TB (sold in 1 TB monthly increments, minimum 1 TB / month)

## Upgrades/options/configurations

### Custom domain

You can place our service behind your domain for no additional charge. Only available on a dedicated network plan.

### 100% SLA guarantee

[Our SLA](/docs/sla) is included in our premium plans.

### Public access code

If you have a product that requires the public sharing of the API access key (eg: for reproducible builds), then you will be billed at a higher rate.

### Proxy connections

The ability to proxy connections is useful for teams with existing robust delivery networks. Pricing starts at 1000 USD / mo. Subject to some restrictions.

### Additional regions

Want lower latency for a specific region? We can set up dedicated nodes in many regions.

Prepaid shared plan users can request a new region through sales. If you consistently use more than 1,000,000 credits a month, the price will be minimal.

Dedicated plan users can add a new region with 2 delivery nodes in that region for approximately 180 USD / month.

### Higher rate limits

We limit each IP (not each key) to 20 new connections per second. If you need other limits, please contact us.
